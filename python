""" Alex has selected a secret number in a guessing game. The player receives feedback after each guess, helping them determine the correct value. The game continues until the player guesses correctly or decides to quit by entering '$'.



Feedback indicates if the guess is too small, too large, or correct. Players can choose to play again (by entering any character) or quit (by entering '$').

Input format :
The first line of input consists of a single integer, x, representing Alex's chosen secret number.

Subsequent lines of input consist of a combination of integers n and characters ch, representing the player's guesses and decisions. The input ends when the player decides to quit by entering '$'.

Output format :
For each guess, print a line containing one of the following:

"Value is small" if the guess is smaller than x.
"Value is large" if the guess is larger than x.
"Well Done" if the guess is correct.
"""


x = int()
x = int(input())
ch = 'y'

while (ch != '$'):
    try :
        n = int(input())
        if n<x :
            raise Exception('Value is small')
        elif n>x :
            raise Exception('Value is large')
